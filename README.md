### About me

*Motto: The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried.*

It all started many years ago when I disassembled my cousin's old tape recorder as a kid. That was a turning point in my life. I still remember that moment of fascination when I gazed at the mechanics and electronics inside. It also sparked a chain reaction that led me from AM receivers, amplifiers, guitar overdrives, logic circuits and microprocessors to where I am today.

After graduating in Computer Science (1996) I stayed at the University of West Bohemia for 5 years as a lecturer and Ph.D. student. Another 5 years I worked also as a database, backend and web developer of an university information system which is now used at more than 10 universities in the Czech Republic.

In 2006 I left the university and spent 15 years in the commercial sphere working on startups, maintaining existing software as well as working in research and development (mainly international) teams.

Since mid 2021 I'm back at the university teaching 4 courses. I refurbished two existing ones (Computer Networks, Distributed Systems) and introduced another two (Cloud Computing, Continuous Software Development and Delivery).
